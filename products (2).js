3. Create two filters on top of table
	1. Filter By Operating System
	2. Filter By Brand
   Filters would be in dropdown format and if I choose any brand or operating system then it should update table data accordingly.

4. Below table would be a search button that would search product with name or id.

1. create product listing in products.html with jQuery using products.js
2. when user clicks add to cart button, that product would add to cart (array)
3. display cart below products listing
4. if any existing element in cart is added again then quantity would increase by 1
5. give option to change quantity manually in cart for any product
6. user can delete product from cart
7. give option to empty cart

1. initial commit with task project files provided
2. dynamic product listing
3. add to cart feature
4. update quantity value in cart
5. empty cart feature
